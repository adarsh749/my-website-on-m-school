                    <h1>About Us</h1>
                    <p>XYZ, started 6 years ago, with the vision of creating a new benchmark of excellence in education in India. We now have five preschools and XYZ - a full continuum IB school with an option of middle school ICSE. Neev is a learning community of 1000 children and 200 teachers. The next leap for us is the IB Diploma programme. This new pathway for our children to successful choices of colleges and careers in India and abroad continues our quest to change the definition of education excellence, now for children from 2 yrs (entrusted to us in diapers) to 18 yrs (ready for making life choices).</p><br />

                    <p>The poet who said education is not the filling of a bucket but the lighting of a fire, inspires XYZ. A fire that lasts a lifetime, a fire that is built on rigor, and a fire that manifests itself in self-confidence and creativity. There are 3 forces shaping education today - globalization, brain research, and the digital revolution. In a rapidly globalizing world, where value moves from resources to knowledge to ideas; a world where joining the dots is as essential as the strength of those dots, we strive to achieve that to equip our children to be prepared for the changing world of tomorrow. A good school is one that blunts weaknesses, builds on strengths and has inspiring, capable teachers. This is the kind of school that Neev is set up to be and aspires to stay.</p><br />

                    <p>XYZ is an intellectually challenging, creatively vibrant, and diverse community of children and teachers, set up to meet the needs of a changing India - with the return of neighbourhood schools where children don't have to make the tradeoff of 2 hours of commute for 30 minutes of sports, schools which move beyond either/or, focusing on academics and creative thinking, recognizing that what has helped some of us succeed as global Indians will not meet the needs of our children in a rapidly globalizing world, where value moves from resources to knowledge to ideas; a world where joining the dots is as essential as the strength of those dots.</p>

                        <p>The key to a child realizing his/her full potential is through fostering strong relationship between the school, parents and students. We believe it is vital that parents have an opportunity to be connected to the school in a variety of ways. It is essential for the success of any school that parents are committed, involved and supportive of the decisions the school makes. At Neev, parents are made to feel welcome, valued and listened to. Parents can participate as volunteers for different events, as experts to talk about different topics to the students from their field or help in organizing charity events or discussions on anything important. Communication is the key to any successful relationship. We keep our parents informed of all events, programmes and initiatives by the school so that they can participate and give feedback from time to time for us to do our best. It is our endeavour to see that parents are involved in their child嚙賭号 learning journey and in turn help in building a strong community that is dynamic, diverse and supportive.</p>

At Neev, our mission is to be the benchmark of excellence in education in India. Our Neev teacher community is largely of Indian origin. All teachers at Neev are trained on IB curriculum through regular workshops at the school conducted by IB certified trainers. Visits to IB schools in India and abroad coupled with training sessions by subject experts from other schools form an integral part of the professional development at Neev. A strong teacher foundation course provides teachers the much needed expertise required to take their practice to a level of excellence where the child has no boundaries to learning. Neev teachers are committed to create and maintain an environment where all students have a sense of belonging and feel safe. We promote a working and learning culture that stimulates and supports individuals to be confident and fearless.XYZ values diversity and recognises that different children bring different perspective, idea, knowledge and culture; and that differences bring great strength to our school community. We communicate with our children in a way that is clear, relevant, respectful, accurate and timely. We exemplify transparency and constructive dialogue. The bond or the connection we have with children is the most powerful connection that builds self-awareness, relationship and knowledge. We ensure our children feel safe all the time and believe when a child feels good about themselves; it嚙賭号 easy for them to inculcate core values - grit, honour and grace. It is these core values that Neev seeks to teach children through teachers who are their role models and demonstrate these values through their thoughts, words and deeds.</p>

                        The plan for XYZ Academy campus is developed keeping in mind research on learning environments, curricular philosophy of Neev Academy, developmentally appropriate practices for children and the responses from a parent survey conducted with existing XYZ Academy parents. Beautifully landscaped, lush, vibrant, Neev嚙賭号 campus is the perfect place to learn and be inspired. Our location and setting is fundamental to our ethos and shapes our curriculum encouraging our students to appreciate and learn from nature. We firmly believe that this captures our children's curiosity, stimulates their senses, builds their self-confidence and nurtures their well-being. Housed in a verdant 16-acre campus right in the middle of the city, it provides a vast environmental resource to learn and work which is conducive to learning. The school is in the center of town  located around 4 km from Wind Tunnel Road/Airport Road, or 2 km from HAL Museum/Airport Road. We have designed our classrooms to be naturally ventilated with lots of natural light, have space for discussions and activities and integrate technology into daily work  all at an individual or collaborative level. Students have access to state of the art facilities like laboratories, libraries and computing facilities that are required to support and enhance their learning at school. We, at XYZ Academy, feel that sport is an integral part of education and so we have Basketball and Tennis courts, Football field which can double up for hockey, cricket pitch, an indoor gymnasium and a half Olympic-size swimming pool.

                        . We are growing our PYP (Primary Years Programme) Grades 1 and 2 at our Queens Road campus as an extension to the existing preschool on additional land just behind the preschool. PYP - Neev QR will begin with grades 1 in June 2018 and extend to Grade 3 in the subsequent academic year. The PYP-North final campus is likely to be between the areas of Jakkur and Kogilu, starting in the academic year 2021-22 and until then the team and the children will be at PYP-Neev QR. We are excited by the opportunity to run the PYP programs in a location as beautiful, and central as Neev QR. It is our dream to create the extension in a similar aesthetic form as the existing heritage bungalow that we so painstakingly restored. The only way to survive urban chaos is to reduce commutes. Neighborhood schooling is therefore what all our Early year's centers are set up to achieve. For the PYP, the Neev Yemalur campus was that answer to Central Bangalore communities. PYP-XYZ QR and eventually the North campus is the answer for the North Bangalore communities, improving the quality of life of the younger children while they access a stellar Primary years programme close to home. We are not an organization driven by numbers and will never be. Our mission is to reimagine education for a changing India. And our end goal is always to meet the needs of the growing Neev community in the best possible way.

The school has excellent infrastructure with thoughtfully created spaces. We believe that this provides our children ample room to explore their creativity and express themselves. I look forward to welcoming you into our community and earnestly hope that you personally experience the happiness, warmth and the joy of learning and discovery.</p>

                            <p class="parabooks">On behalf of the XYZ community, I am happy to welcome you to the school year! We look forward to a very positive and productive year together! The MYP builds on the work of the Primary School (the IB PYP) and prepares students for entry to the IB Diploma Programme. The five year journey through the MYP is an exciting ride on the wave of opportunities in and out of the classroom. The MYP curriculum requires the teaching of eight compulsory subject groups across the five year programme. The subjects retain their own identity and are taught as discrete subjects. During the year some topics are explored across a number of subject areas to form an interdisciplinary unit of work. In grades 9 and 10 the students have options to make choices in various subject groups like Art and Sciences to enhance learning. The year 5 culminates with the personal project that encourages students to practice and strengthen their approaches to learning (ATL) skills, to consolidate prior and subject-specific learning, and to develop an area of personal interest. At Neev, we strive to create a culture which encourages students to discover their truest potential. Students at Neev, be rest assured, will be supported all through their learning journey by highly trained staff in the midst of excellent facilities in a beautiful campus. We genuinely value your involvement and support in your child嚙賭号 education! Your active participation is the key to our children嚙賭号 success. Here嚙賭号 to a fulfilling school year as we work together to make our school a great place to work and learn each day!</p>

At Neev Academy, we are sensitive to the fact that all our learners are potentially different, and we are committed to supporting and celebrating these differences in a programme built for breadth and depth of learning. Despite this rigour, the diploma programme at Neev also values learning beyond the classroom, especially experiences that challenge our notion of identity. Our course offerings are liberal and broad, and ably supported by a team of educators who are enthusiastic, experienced and caring. This team ensures that every student is at an appropriate stage of readiness to balance life at university and beyond. We welcome students who seek a refreshing approach to learning, who are independent, and who value their relationships with people and with the environment.</p>

Distance learning will serve as a platform in enabling the students to reach their highest potential and access their respective grade curriculum from the safety of their homes. In the global times of this pandemic, we take this opportunity to continue the process of learning when the school is closed for varied reasons (epidemic, political etc). You can access all the communication from Neev in response to Coronavirus here.</p>
